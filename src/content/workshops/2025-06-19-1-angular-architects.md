title: 'Future-Proof Angular Architectures: NGRX Signal Store, Nx, DDD & Micro Frontends'
description: "In this interactive workshop, we use Angular’s latest innovations to build modern and highly maintainable architectures. You learn how to structure an extensive application using a Mono Repo and proven ideas from Strategic Design (DDD).

We discuss categorizing the individual parts of our application and how to enforce our architecture with tools such as Nx or Sheriff. On top of our Strategic Design, we implement a Micro Frontend Architecture with Module Federation.

Then, we discover how Angular’s new Signals concept fit our modern architecture and how we need to adapt our thinking to use them to establish a reactive data flow. We discuss vital similarities and differences to RxJS as well as possibilities for an interplay between RxJS and Signals. Also, we look into fine-grained and zone-less change detection and build our state management on top of the new and lightweight NGRX Signal Store. We also show how the new Resource API fits in, including the new Streaming Resources and HTTP Resources. To cover repeating use cases with just a few lines of code, we also implement some custom features for the Signal Store."

In this interactive workshop, we use Angular’s latest innovations to build a modern and maintainable architecture. 

We start with Standalone Components and learn how to structure a large application using a Mono Repo and Strategic Design – a discipline from Domain-driven Design (DDD).

We discuss categorizing the individual parts of our application and how to enforce our architecture with tools such as Nx or Sheriff. On top of our Strategic Design, we implement a Micro Frontend Architecture with Module Federation. Then, we discover how Angular’s new Signals fit our modern architecture. 

We discuss fine-grained change detection and State Management with the new NGRX Signal Store. We implement some custom features for the Signal Store to cover repeating and complex use cases with just a few lines of code. Finally, we discuss how the new Signal component will help to simplify our architecture further and how they work together with traditional components.
