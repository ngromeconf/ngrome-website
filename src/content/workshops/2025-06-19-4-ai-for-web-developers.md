Recently, he took some time to dive into the rapidly growing world of AI unpacking buzzwords like multimodality, agents, RAG, large language models (LLMs), tokens, and embeddings amongst others. 

He wanted to go beyond the hype and truly understand how these tools can enhance the way we build. 

Now, Tamas is excited to share what he’s learned in a practical, developer-friendly way. His hands-on workshop is designed to empower fellow web developers whether they're just starting their journey or have years of experience.
