In this interactive workshop, we leverage the latest innovations in AI to build intelligent and scalable web applications using developer-friendly techniques and tools.

We start by demystifying core AI concepts including multimodality, model parameters, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), large language models (LLMs), tokens, and embeddings, creating a strong foundational understanding.

We explore practical architectures and patterns for integrating AI seamlessly into web projects. We'll cover structuring applications for optimal AI integration, focusing on simplicity and maintainability.

We discuss how to categorize AI-driven components effectively and enforce best practices using modern tooling, ensuring robust and clean implementation.

## PART 1: DEMYSTIFYING AI FOR DEVELOPERS

- Understanding model parameters, multimodality, RAG, LLMs, tokens, and embeddings

- Breaking down complex AI concepts into actionable insights

- Essential tools and libraries for practical AI integration

## PART 2: ARCHITECTING INTELLIGENT WEB APPLICATIONS

- Integrating AI capabilities with Angular

- Structuring your project for seamless AI integration

- Ensuring maintainability and scalability of AI-driven web applications

# PART 3: ENFORCING BEST PRACTICES WITH AI

- Categorising and organising AI-driven components

- Best practices for data management and AI interaction

- Tools and techniques to enforce AI architecture quality and consistency
