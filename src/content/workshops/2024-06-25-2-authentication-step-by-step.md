title: Authentication from Step 0 to Stepped Up
description: "All applications require authentication. How do we add authentication, how does authorization fit in, and how can we best defend against authentication-related breaches?

In this half-day hands-on workshop, you’ll apply best practices to add authentication to an Angular application. Then, you’ll learn about a new OAuth 2.0 specification to increase users’ identity assurance and protect key resources. You’ll implement these techniques in a sample Angular application so you can apply these concepts to your application."

All applications require authentication. How do we add authentication, how does authorization fit in, and how can we best defend against authentication-related breaches?

In this half-day hands-on workshop, you'll apply best practices to add authentication to an Angular application. Then, you'll learn about a new OAuth 2.0 specification to increase users' identity assurance and protect key resources. You'll implement these techniques in a sample Angular application so you can apply these concepts to your application.

### Our goals for this workshop are
1. Introduce authorization and authentication using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
2. Utilize an Identity Provider to manage authentication and inspect the handshake in the browser
3. Leverage Angular building blocks for protecting resources
4. Introduce the OAuth 2.0 Step Up Authentication Challenge
5. Add step-up authentication to Angular applications
6. Handle step-up authentication challenges from the backend
7. Cover the next steps for elevating authentication security
