What You Will Learn:

‚úîÔ∏è Master Signals
- Dive Deep: Go beyond the basics and understand the inner workings of Signals, Angular's new powerful reactivity system.
- Real-World Practice: Gain practical experience by applying signal best practices, reinforcing your understanding of how signals work.

‚úîÔ∏è Craft Modern, Efficient Components:
- Modern APIs: Leverage signal inputs, model inputs, function-based outputs, signal queries, and more to build smarter, more reactive components.
- Master derived local state with linkedSignal and async state with resource & rxResource

‚úîÔ∏è Go Zoneless & Signal-based change detection
- Embrace Angular's new, faster, and more efficient zoneless change detection with Signals and learn how to benefit from them.

‚úîÔ∏è Enhance Development Techniques
- Master inject patterns: Go beyond basic service injection and discover innovative code patterns that promote reusability, maintainability, and scalability in your Angular projects.

‚úîÔ∏è Architect Angular Workspaces like a Pro
- Standalone: Understand and unlock the benefits of a more modular architecture with standalone components, directives and pipes.
- Function-based APIs and provide*- Learn how to create better APIs that are easier to maintain and reuse which align with Angular‚Äôs vision.
- @defer like a PRO: Dramatically reduce bundle size and initial load time with @defer. Get in-depth experience about everything @defer has to offer and how to not break it!
- Bonus: Lazy load services: Learn how to lazy load services using injectLazy.
