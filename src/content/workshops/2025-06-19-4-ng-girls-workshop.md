Who is it for?
Are you a woman interested in learning how to build web applications with the latest technologies? We have good news for you: We are holding a one-day workshops for beginners! See the full list of upcoming events.

We believe that the IT industry will greatly benefit from bringing more women into technology. We want to give you an opportunity to learn how to program and become a developer.

During the workshop you will build and deploy your very first Angular Web Application! Angular is an open-source platform for building web application, developed by Google and the community. It provides various tools to easily create a dynamic, interactive app that can run on desktop browsers, mobile and even robots.

The workshop is free of charge. Just fill out the application form. Don't wait too long - you can apply for a pass only until the stated deadline.

For the workshop you'll need some basic knowledge in web development: HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript or any other programming language. If you're a total beginner, that's ok! We'll send you some resources to catch up, and give you special attention during the workshop.

Join our community to stay informed of new events.
