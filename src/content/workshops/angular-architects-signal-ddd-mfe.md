title: 'Modern Angular Architectures: Signal Store, NX, DDD & Micro Frontends'
description: In this interactive workshop, we use Angular’s latest innovations to build a modern and maintainable architecture. <br /><br />We start with Standalone Components and learn how to structure a large application using a Mono Repo and Strategic Design – a discipline from Domain-driven Design (DDD).<br /><br /> We discuss categorizing the individual parts of our application and how to enforce our architecture with tools such as Nx or Sheriff. On top of our Strategic Design, we implement a Micro Frontend Architecture with Module Federation. Then, we discover how Angular’s new Signals fit our modern architecture. <br /><br />We discuss fine-grained change detection and State Management with the new NGRX Signal Store. We implement some custom features for the Signal Store to cover repeating and complex use cases with just a few lines of code. Finally, we discuss how the new Signal component will help to simplify our architecture further and how they work together with traditional components.
