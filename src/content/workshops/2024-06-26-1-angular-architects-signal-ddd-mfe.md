title: 'Modern Angular Architectures: Signal Store, NX, DDD & Micro Frontends'
description: "In this interactive workshop, we use Angular’s latest innovations to build a modern and maintainable architecture. We start with Standalone Components and learn how to structure a large application using a Mono Repo and Strategic Design – a discipline from Domain-driven Design (DDD).  

We discuss categorizing the individual parts of our application and how to enforce our architecture with tools such as Nx or Sheriff. On top of our Strategic Design, we implement a Micro Frontend Architecture with Module Federation. 

Then, we discover how Angular’s new Signals fit our modern architecture. We discuss fine-grained change detection and State Management with the new NGRX Signal Store. We implement some custom features for the Signal Store to cover repeating and complex use cases with just a few lines of code. Finally, we discuss how the new Signal component will help to simplify our architecture further and how they work together with traditional components."
