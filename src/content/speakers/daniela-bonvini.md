name: Daniela Bonvini
biography: Having studied foreign languages for many years, I stumbled upon HTML and CSS and have been fascinated by the frontend side of programming ever since, marveling at the enormous creativity this world offers. I like to think of the web as a blank canvas, and I'm always excited to craft something new with code. I love the challenge of creating something visually appealing and functional that people can interact with and enjoy.
