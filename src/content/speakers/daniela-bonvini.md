    title: Angular Signals - what's all the fuss about?
    description: Signals have transformed reactive programming in Angular. But what exactly are they? And can they replace RxJs? In this context,I will explain what signals are and how they operate,from their inception to implementation. I will also show how to switch existing logic from observables to signals.
biography: Having studied foreign languages for many years, I stumbled upon HTML and CSS and have been fascinated by the frontend side of programming ever since, marveling at the enormous creativity this world offers. I like to think of the web as a blank canvas, and I'm always excited to craft something new with code. I love the challenge of creating something visually appealing and functional that people can interact with and enjoy.
