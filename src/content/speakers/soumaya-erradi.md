    title: 'Angular PWA: crafting apps that adapt anywhere'
    description: Ready to boost your Angular App? Take it up a notch by turning it into a Progressive Web App (PWA). With Angular's help, upgrading your app to a PWA and setting up the necessary service worker is easy. The service worker keeps your app accessible even offline, storing all important data. Plus, your PWA can act like a desktop or mobile app, giving users a native app feel. Join us as we explore Angular PWAs, showing you how to set up your app and make it look good on any device.
