            title: The Art of Testing
            description: “I only write unit tests to ease my conscience—real value comes from E2E tests.” You often hear statements like this whispered behind closed doors - or maybe agree with them yourself. Is there a grain of truth to it? The classic testing pyramid suggests the opposite, emphasizing unit tests as the foundation. However, modern approaches tend to shift focus toward the middle of the pyramid—what is commonly referred to as integration testing. At the same time, E2E tests indeed provide the highest value but come with limiting constraints. In this talk, I’ll explore these different perspectives and demonstrate, through concrete examples, which testing strategies work best in various scenarios. Testing isn’t black and white. The real challenge is finding the right balance. In that sense, there is an undeniable element of art involved. But to make the right choices, you need to understand both the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

            title: Angular’s Hybrid Rendering - Choosing the Right Strategy for Every Route
            description: Hybrid Rendering in Angular 19 introduces a flexible approach to balancing Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Prerendering (SSG), and Client-Side Rendering (CSR). This talk explores how developers can leverage hybrid rendering to optimize performance, improve SEO, and enhance user experience by selecting the right rendering strategy for each route.

            title: Why State is the Most Important Part of Your Angular Application
            description: State is the foundation of every modern Angular application. A well-structured state management strategy determines not only how data flows through an application but also how scalable, maintainable, and performant it becomes. Without proper state management, applications quickly become hard to debug, difficult to scale, and prone to inconsistencies. This talk explores why state is the most crucial part of an Angular application, how to choose the right state management approach, and what common pitfalls to avoid. Whether using NgRx, Akita, Signals, or a simple service-based approach, understanding and structuring state effectively is the key to long-term success.

            title: 'The Missing Link in Angular’s Signal Story: Resource API and httpResource'
            description: Signals will shape Angular’s future in terms of reactivity and change detection. The new Resource API, along with its httpResource, adds an essential piece to this story by providing an official solution for asynchronously loading data within a Signal-based dataflow. In this session, we explore all the details you need to work effectively with this powerful API. Topics include managing different states, handling errors, streaming data, preventing race conditions, and canceling unnecessary requests. We also discuss how it interacts with RxJS through rxResource and demonstrate how to update loaded values. By the end, you’ll have a comprehensive understanding of the possibilities offered by this groundbreaking new API.

            title: 'The Lord of the Stores: A Quest for Angular State Mastery'
            description: 'The realm of Angular is vast, but with great applications comes an even greater burden—state management. Many have set out to tame it, yet countless projects have fallen to the dark forces of spaghetti state, uncontrolled mutations, and chaotic side effects. But hope is not lost: three Stores have emerged, forged in the depths of NgRx to bring order and scalability: Global Store, vast and unifying; Component Store, swift and precise; Signal Store, reactive and efficient. Yet power alone is not enough, as without wisdom, these tools can lead even the noblest developer astray. In this talk, we embark on a Lord of The Rings inspired journey to understand the strengths and trade-offs of each store, learn how to choose the right one for different scenarios, and explore small examples to see them in action. The fate of Angular state management now rests in your hands; for the time will soon come when stores will shape the fortunes of all devs.'

It will be an opportunity to learn new tricks, create abstractions and solve common but often not easy problems by combining several components patterns, directives and dependency injection strategies. We will see how to use composition, create coumpond components, integrate 3rd party libraries, create overlay components such as tootip and modals, create generic (TS) components, build dynamic UI and many other use cases"
