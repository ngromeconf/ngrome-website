            title: 'The Missing Link in Angular‚Äôs Signal Story: Resource API and httpResource'
            description: Signals will shape Angular‚Äôs future in terms of reactivity and change detection. The new Resource API, along with its httpResource, adds an essential piece to this story by providing an official solution for asynchronously loading data within a Signal-based dataflow. In this session, we explore all the details you need to work effectively with this powerful API. Topics include managing different states, handling errors, streaming data, preventing race conditions, and canceling unnecessary requests. We also discuss how it interacts with RxJS through rxResource and demonstrate how to update loaded values. By the end, you‚Äôll have a comprehensive understanding of the possibilities offered by this groundbreaking new API.

            title: Why State is the Most Important Part of Your Angular Application
            description: State is the foundation of every modern Angular application. A well-structured state management strategy determines not only how data flows through an application but also how scalable, maintainable, and performant it becomes. Without proper state management, applications quickly become hard to debug, difficult to scale, and prone to inconsistencies. This talk explores why state is the most crucial part of an Angular application, how to choose the right state management approach, and what common pitfalls to avoid. Whether using NgRx, Akita, Signals, or a simple service-based approach, understanding and structuring state effectively is the key to long-term success.

            title: The Art of Testing
            description: ‚ÄúI only write unit tests to ease my conscience‚Äîreal value comes from E2E tests.‚Äù You often hear statements like this whispered behind closed doors - or maybe agree with them yourself. Is there a grain of truth to it? The classic testing pyramid suggests the opposite, emphasizing unit tests as the foundation. However, modern approaches tend to shift focus toward the middle of the pyramid‚Äîwhat is commonly referred to as integration testing. At the same time, E2E tests indeed provide the highest value but come with limiting constraints. In this talk, I‚Äôll explore these different perspectives and demonstrate, through concrete examples, which testing strategies work best in various scenarios. Testing isn‚Äôt black and white. The real challenge is finding the right balance. In that sense, there is an undeniable element of art involved. But to make the right choices, you need to understand both the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

            title: "Dependency Injection and the Order of Micro-Frontends"
            description: "When it comes to Angular, Dependency Injection is one of its most underrated superpowers. But what happens when multiple Angular apps need to live on the same page? In this talk, we‚Äôll start from the basics of Angular's DI to understand how it works, how it helps reduce complexity‚Äîand how it can turn into a trap when misused in distributed scenarios. We‚Äôll walk through a practical pattern for sharing services and state across multiple Angular apps, while keeping full isolation in local environments. All of this using Angular‚Äôs native features, no external libraries, and the power of resolution modifiers. üéÅ What you‚Äôll walk away with: - A solid understanding of how Dependency Injection works in Angular - The core principles (and pitfalls) of micro-frontend architecture - A practical and scalable approach to share state and services across multiple Angular MF apps"

            title: 'The Lord of the Stores: A Quest for Angular State Mastery'
            description: 'The realm of Angular is vast, but with great applications comes an even greater burden‚Äîstate management. Many have set out to tame it, yet countless projects have fallen to the dark forces of spaghetti state, uncontrolled mutations, and chaotic side effects. But hope is not lost: three Stores have emerged, forged in the depths of NgRx to bring order and scalability: Global Store, vast and unifying; Component Store, swift and precise; Signal Store, reactive and efficient. Yet power alone is not enough, as without wisdom, these tools can lead even the noblest developer astray. In this talk, we embark on a Lord of The Rings inspired journey to understand the strengths and trade-offs of each store, learn how to choose the right one for different scenarios, and explore small examples to see them in action. The fate of Angular state management now rests in your hands; for the time will soon come when stores will shape the fortunes of all devs.'

It will be an opportunity to learn new tricks, create abstractions and solve common but often not easy problems by combining several components patterns, directives and dependency injection strategies. We will see how to use composition, create coumpond components, integrate 3rd party libraries, create overlay components such as tootip and modals, create generic (TS) components, build dynamic UI and many other use cases"

And to be honest, we‚Äôve had enough of the hype, the fear, and the confusion around AI. In our closing keynote, Mike Ryan and Brian Love will be cooking with a new open-source library that combines Angular Signals and the Resource API to bring LLMs‚Äîand joy‚Äîinto your app in meaningful ways. We‚Äôll show you how to stream responses, handle tool calls, and build contextual UIs that feel intelligent‚Äîwithout abandoning the Angular patterns you already know. Expect live demos, real-world use cases, and a fresh take on what it means to ship meaningful AI features in modern frontend apps.'
